\section{1D Gaussian Filter}
% Qeustion: "Compare your function with MATLABâ€™s built-in fspecial. What are the differences?"


\section{Convolving an image with a 2D Gaussian}
% Question 1:
% Show that the outputs of convolution with the 2D kernel (i.e. the one corresponding to the two 1D kernels) and convolution with 1D kernels are essentially the same.
% Use kernel length of 11.
% Report the numerical equivalence as well as plots at every stage of filtering pipeline.
% Question 2: Explain the benefits of kernel separability, shortly.


\section{Gaussian Derivative}
