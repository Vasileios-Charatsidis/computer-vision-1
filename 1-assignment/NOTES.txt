NOTE: 
So I have a theory as to what's the problem. The way we have it right now our light 
sources vectors represent the directions but not the intensity of the sources (see
http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/courses/2503/fall11/Handouts/a1.pdf near the bottom 
of the first page). To reflect that they have the same intensity they all should 
have the same magnitud/norm. I think that will also make all the sources to be weighted 
"equally", if that makes sense ... I think that's also why the albedo figure still 
has some bright spots. Some sources are brighter and they affect the computation 
of the albedo.

Additionally, the assignment says the light sources must be "directional (unit) 
vectors (...) yielded to a scale factor", so I thought we had to normalize them first
to make sure they all have same intensity, and then scale them to experiment. 

So with that in mind I've been printing the V matrix and I noticed that once we 
normalize the vectors don't represent the coordinates in the same way. I tried to 
find a way to keep both properties 
- all v must have the same magnitud/norm (ideally 1)
- the relative coordinates should mantain (i.e [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0] for the 
frontal)

second problem is, everytime I ran it with unit vectors the albedos were outside the 
[0,1] range.
